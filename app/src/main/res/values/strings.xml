    <string name="letter_aces_high">There goes the siren that warns of the air raid. \nThere comes the sound of the guns sending flak, \nOut for the scramble, we have got to get airborne\nGot to get up for the coming attack\nJump in the cockpit and start up the engines\nRemove all the wheel blocks, there is no time to waste\nGathering speed as we head down the runway\nGot to get airborne before it is too late\nRunning, scrambling, flying\nRolling, turning, diving, going in again\nRunning, scrambling, flying\nRolling, turning, diving\nRun, live to fly\nFly to live\nDo or die\nWo not you run?\nLive to fly\nFly to live\nAces high\nMove in to fire at the mainstream of bombers\nLet off a sharp burst and then turn away\nRoll over, spin round to come in behind them\nMove to their blindsides and firing again\nBandits at 8 on clock move in behind us\nTen ME-109s out of the sun\nAscending and turning our spitfires to face them\nHeading straight for them, I press down my guns\nRolling, turning, diving\nRolling, turning, diving, doing it again\nRolling, turning, diving\nRolling, turning, diving\nRun, live to fly\nFly to live\nDo or die\nWo not you run?\nLive to fly\nFly to live\nAces high\n\nFonte: https://www.letras.mus.br/iron-maiden/19286/</string>
    <string name="letter_make_believe">Sat beside the meadow\nWatching weeds agrow\nCleaned up all the ashes\nOf my soul\nWrote down my own sentence\nNow you take your way\nFades the last remembrance\nOf your lovely pretty face\nI, after all\nJust a lonely man\nA lonely heart\nWorking on the future\nFloating on fate\nFaced the circunstances\nCleared up the shades\nSo make believe\nThere is no sorrow in your eyes\nCan not you see\nWe could never get back from the start?\nMinutes waiting, life is been wasted\nMaybe I wanna die some other day\nAnother day\nHear the whispers of your hope\nThe answer was not told\nNo, do not laugh seeing me cry\nThe end I have left behind\nMake believe\nThere is no sorrow in your eyes\nCan not you see\nWe could never get back from the start?\nMinutes waiting, life is been wasted\nAnd I have tried\nMaybe you deny\nWords of peace\nFor the future of our lives\nBring to me\nSomething else than a broken heart\nI wo not wait until my life is wasted\nMaybe I wanna die some other day\nAnother day\nAnother day\nAnother day\nMaybe I wanna die some other day\n\nFonte: https://www.letras.mus.br/angra/98449/</string>
