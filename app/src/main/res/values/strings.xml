    <string name="letter_aces_high">There goes the siren that warns of the air raid. \nThere comes the sound of the guns sending flak, \nOut for the scramble, we have got to get airborne\nGot to get up for the coming attack\nJump in the cockpit and start up the engines\nRemove all the wheel blocks, there is no time to waste\nGathering speed as we head down the runway\nGot to get airborne before it is too late\nRunning, scrambling, flying\nRolling, turning, diving, going in again\nRunning, scrambling, flying\nRolling, turning, diving\nRun, live to fly\nFly to live\nDo or die\nWo not you run?\nLive to fly\nFly to live\nAces high\nMove in to fire at the mainstream of bombers\nLet off a sharp burst and then turn away\nRoll over, spin round to come in behind them\nMove to their blindsides and firing again\nBandits at 8 on clock move in behind us\nTen ME-109s out of the sun\nAscending and turning our spitfires to face them\nHeading straight for them, I press down my guns\nRolling, turning, diving\nRolling, turning, diving, doing it again\nRolling, turning, diving\nRolling, turning, diving\nRun, live to fly\nFly to live\nDo or die\nWo not you run?\nLive to fly\nFly to live\nAces high\n\nFonte: https://www.letras.mus.br/iron-maiden/19286/</string>
    <string name="letter_make_believe">Sat beside the meadow\nWatching weeds agrow\nCleaned up all the ashes\nOf my soul\nWrote down my own sentence\nNow you take your way\nFades the last remembrance\nOf your lovely pretty face\nI, after all\nJust a lonely man\nA lonely heart\nWorking on the future\nFloating on fate\nFaced the circunstances\nCleared up the shades\nSo make believe\nThere is no sorrow in your eyes\nCan not you see\nWe could never get back from the start?\nMinutes waiting, life is been wasted\nMaybe I wanna die some other day\nAnother day\nHear the whispers of your hope\nThe answer was not told\nNo, do not laugh seeing me cry\nThe end I have left behind\nMake believe\nThere is no sorrow in your eyes\nCan not you see\nWe could never get back from the start?\nMinutes waiting, life is been wasted\nAnd I have tried\nMaybe you deny\nWords of peace\nFor the future of our lives\nBring to me\nSomething else than a broken heart\nI wo not wait until my life is wasted\nMaybe I wanna die some other day\nAnother day\nAnother day\nAnother day\nMaybe I wanna die some other day\n\nFonte: https://www.letras.mus.br/angra/98449/</string>
    <string name="letter_stairway_to_heaven">There is a lady who is sure\nAll that glitters is gold\nAnd she is buying a stairway to heaven\nWhen she gets there she knows\nIf the stores are all closed\nWith a word she can get what she came for\nAnd she is buying a stairway to heaven\nThere is a sign on the wall\nBut she wants to be sure\nCause you know, sometimes words have two meanings\nIn the tree by the brook\nThere is a songbird who sings\nSometimes all of our thoughts are mis given\nIt makes me wonder\nIt makes me wonder\nThere is a feeling I get when I look to the west\nAnd my spirit is crying for leaving\nIn my thoughts I have seen rings of smoke through the trees\nAnd the voices of those who stand looking\nIt makes me wonder\nIt really makes me wonder\nAnd it is whispered that soon\nIf we all call the tune\nThen the piper will lead us to reason\nAnd a new day will dawn\nFor those who stand long\nAnd the forests will echo with laughter\nIf there is a bustle in your hedgerow\nDo not be alarmed now\nIt is just a Spring clean for the May queen\nYes, there are two paths you can go by\nBut in the long run\nThere is still time to change the road you are on\nAnd it makes me wonder\nYour head is humming and it wo not go\nIn case you do not know\nThe piper is calling you to join him\nDear lady, can you hear the wind blow\nAnd did you know\nYour stairway lies on the whispering wind\nAnd as we wind on down the road\nOur shadows taller than our souls\nThere walks a lady we all know\nWho shines white light and wants to show\nHow everything still turns to gold\nAnd if you listen very hard\nThe tune will come to you, at last\nWhen all are one and one is all, yeah\nTo be a rock and not to roll\nAnd she is buying a stairway to heaven\n\nFonte: https://www.letras.mus.br/led-zeppelin/64052/</string>
